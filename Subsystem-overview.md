# Pulse Subsystems
#### Usage tab

## Overview
Hero image

In order to talk about subsytems, we need to be able to correctly assess where a product or feature are in the adoption lifecycle. 
There are generally 5 publicly facing adoption levels of Pulse that can involve subsystem usage.

1. **Pulse Toe Dipper**: product or feature is using Effra as the primary font for the screens;
2. **Pulse Starter**: product or feature is beginning to use design tokens; UI Light theme primary/secondary/neutrals
3. **Pulse Adjacent**: Tokens inform product design; coding visual designs into production (hard coded or mix/match actual CSS tokens)
4. **Pulse Legacy**: Pulse adopted! This is likely going to be where most products/features live in the Pulse ecosystem; Pulse will continue to grow and evolve, but most products won't be using newer versions and the adoption may be a version or two behind the latest version
5. **Pulse Latest**: The most current publicly shipping version of Pulse; mostly used for evolving Pulse coded products to include the latest features, themes, componentry; Design will be the first adopters for Latest

**Pulse Alpha**: An offiical sandbox and test for proof of concepts and next generation approaches. This is not something that is supported for use in production, but evaluating what may make it into the Latest branch.

As of this writing, the only complete version in product is for Livongo.com. It is using a legacy version of Pulse 1.*. The sales instance base site is Pulse Toe Dipper as it uses Effra and legacy brand colors (but does not refer to the colors or font-family in a tokenized way):

## Anatomy
image from Figma upload: Annotated Figma component variant(s)

## Variants and options
You can inspect each variant and style in the Figma tab. ["Color overrides" as a subsection here].

Variant Name variant 1
Note for variant 1: [Write about the specific use of variant and the role it serves in an interface. Write it in relation to other variants to give context and guidance. Always include specific scenarios that are appropriate, considerations, and any direction on limitations or when not to use variant]
Variant Name variant 2
Note for variant 2: [Write about the specific use of variant and the role it serves in an interface. Write it in relation to other variants to give context and guidance. Always include specific scenarios that are appropriate, considerations, and any direction on limitations or when not to use variant]
Variant Name variant 3
Note for variant 3: [Write about the specific use of variant and the role it serves in an interface. Write it in relation to other variants to give context and guidance. Always include specific scenarios that are appropriate, considerations, and any direction on limitations or when not to use variant]
etc

### Options
Figma upload, annotated in ZH? for each option example

Options title 1, Example: States
Note for Option 1 
[Highlight when a component supports different states.]

[State name 1] [Component name] types
[State name 2] [Component name] types
[State name 3] [Component name] types
[State name 4] [Component name] types
[State name 5] [Component name] types
[State name 6] [Component name] types

[Include any considerations for each state (e.g., Loading) and any platform-unique instances.]

Options 2, Example: Sizing
Note for options 2: [Sections describing sizing options should breakdown all sizing options available and context as to when to use them.]
[Size name] [Component name] size
[Size name] [Component name] size

[Options title 3, Ex: "Icons"] options
[Sections describing an optional feature of a component (e.g., icons support) should be broken down of all different styling options available, when to use said optional feature, best practices, and when or how NOT to use them. Best to clarify if intention of use differs between Pulse kits ]

[Options title 4, Ex: "Destructive"] options
[Write about the specific use of variant and the role it serves in an interface. Write it in relation to other variants to give context and guidance. Always include specific scenarios that are appropriate, considerations, and any direction on limitations or when not to use variant]

## Placement
[use 2 column layout]

Placement guidelines title 1
Hero image(s) of grayscale wireframe with the placement in Color
[This section is an example of when a full-scale image is used to demonstrate placement, alongside an title and description. The image can display an entire desktop or mobile view, partial view of a desktop or mobile view, full or partial view of a complex component, or a general layout of basic comments. Write a general description about what is in the full-width image. May or may not include badging to specify specific parts of the image. Can also discuss how a component RESIZES across all of Placement sections]

Placement guidelines title 2
Img upload for each guideline
[Write a description about the image demonstration of placement. Take notes on what the general behavior is, any exceptional worth demonstrating, how it may alter across different media queries etc.]

[Write a description about the image demonstration of placement. Take notes on what the general behavior is, any exceptional worth demonstrating, how it may alter across different media queries etc.]

Placement guidelines title 3
(This section is an example of when utilizing Rules widget to demonstrate placement guidelines for component). [This is a paragraph description of what this guidance is about]

then do and don't examples and any other Rules

## Interaction (optional)

## Content guidelines
[All of content guides should be broken down as sections (i.e., each guideline, a section). Each section has a bold paragraph title followed by a description as paragraph, followed by using the Rules widget. Content guidelines can be used for SPECIFIC content or icons usage within the component.] 

[Be succinct]

[Text used in button should generally be one or two words, four at max. Fewer than 20 characters should be used (including spaces).
