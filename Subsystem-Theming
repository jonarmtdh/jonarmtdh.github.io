# Summary
This document is written from the perspective of someone needing to take existing design work and re-theme it with new colors and fonts.
This tutorial will reference Pulse: Components as well as Pulse: Core Styles libraries. 

## Who is this for?
Core UX members who are tasked with helping other product design team creating cobranded or client-branded styles for clients. If you are not a member of Core UX, this is still a useful tutorial, but you should work with a member of Core UX to ensure the proper process and have the necessary Figma privileges.
You will be duplicating the Pulse Core Styles library, renaming it and editing your renamed version to make any color and font changes. Then we'll show you how to swap any existing style library with the new library you have made and watch the magic as Pulse components get restyled. 
I'll be using the current design system, Pulse, to demonstrate how to leverage all the work on Pulse to take work designed using  instances of Pulse Library Components and the Pulse Style Library. For the purpose of this document, we'll focus on the style library only, not the Pulse Components.

## Assumptions 
This tutorial assumes:
You have a knowledge of how Figma structures work areas, projects and working files. If you need to understand this aspect of Figma, you can learn more here.
You have work that uses Pulse components and styles, with no custom overrides
any overrides will not be affected by a library swap; text doesn't count as an override but text styling does count as an override, so any custom text styling outside of Pulse styles will not be affected by any style library swap
You have privileges to make a folder, edit files in that folder and Figma privileges to publish libraries
You save to version history often, especially prior to performing major changes to a given document, whether or not it is a style library; Figma does autosaves, but not always at the best points of activity
You are making changes to a file that may potentially affect other work, so you are moving carefully through this process
You know how to edit color styles (colors only, not renaming the colors)
You have access to a custom Figma plugin called "Semantic Color Sync"
You are part of Core UX and have editor access to Pulse libraries
You will not rename any of the colors, styles or components in the Pulse Core Style library; this cannot be stressed enough: DO NOT RENAME ANY STYLES

### Plugins required
Semantic Color Sync

## Step 1: Ensure you have edit privileges
Wherever you will be working on the documents that will be themed differently, make sure you have edit access to the appropriate project. You need to create a folder inside of that project. If a client or project already has a folder, make sure you have edit access to that folder. Will will move your new library into this folder. 

Naming tip
Use ClientName Theme Style Library. If we were working on a client called CVS, we would name the library:  CVS Theme Style Library. There may be only one file in this project, but this will ensure the style library is easy to locate.

## Step 2: Duplicate the Pulse: Core Styles library
Locate the Select the Pulse Style Library, right click and select duplicate:
`TK image`

Figma will create a new style library that has a (Copy) at the end of the title:
`TK image`

This is the library we will move to our project from Step 1

## Step 3: Move the duplicate Pulse style library 
Simply drag the file to the project in the left hand project navigation rail in Figma:

`TK image`

Your left rail will look different, this is just an example for reference.

## Step 4: Rename the new style library 
Right click on the library file and select "Rename":

`TK Image`

I've renamed the duplicated library to "Pulse: Neutral".
You should also open the file and edit the Cover page so that it can't be confused with the actual Pulse: Core Styles style library:

`TK Image`
